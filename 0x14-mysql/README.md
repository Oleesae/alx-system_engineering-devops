# 0x14. MySQL

- Visit 'https://www.devart.com/dbforge/mysql/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu/' to install mysql on your server
- if any issue arises as results to missing keys (e.g ... NO_PUBKEY B7B3B788A8D3785C AND NO_PUBKEY 467B942D3A79BD29 are some I've encountered) - simply relacing the key value with the one in the instruction and repeating the previous instruction should solve your issue
- Use the instruction in the same link provided above to add a user. (* be careful not to copy and paste, to avoid mistakes in the parameters)
- If issues with the new user is encountered simply drop the user and start again
